- Hey there, I'm NexturnAlpha and welcome to my ReadMe. I'm a new FiveM server developer thats looking to get into more coding and learn how to code from scratch. This will basically act as a journal for my journey.

- I'm looking to possibly collabarate or even be tought different skills revolving around LUA coding

- If you've made it this far I'm shocked because theres not much else to this.
